# README

Members of the [OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/) create and manage 
technical content in this TC GitHub repository (https://github.com/oasis-tcs/oc2arch/) as part of the TC's chartered work (the program of 
work and deliverables described in its [charter](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php).

OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in [GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work), 
are governed by the OASIS [TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process), 
[IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), and other policies. While they make use of public GitHub repositories, 
these repositories are distinct from [OASIS Open Repositories](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories), which are used 
for development of open source [licensed](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) content.

## Description

All OpenC2 Profiles work within an implied architecture as well as in a common language. The purpose of this repository is to develop a
specification of the standard architecture to guide all developers of Profiles.

This repository is organized with three branches:

 * The *_Working_* branch contains work product 
 material that is actively being developed, and 
 subject to potentially frequent and significant 
 change. Contributors to the work product should 
 target their inputs to the Working branch.

 * The *_Published_* branch contains TC-approved 
[Committee Specification](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dCommitteeSpec) (CS) or [OASIS Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dOASISstandard) (OS) 
versions of the work product. Until the first CS 
is approved, the Published branch will not contain 
a complete version of the work product.

the [OASIS TC Administrator](mailto:tc-admin@oasis-open.org).  For questions about content in this repository, please contact the TC Chair or

## Preparation Note

Here is a customized command line which will generate HTML from this markdown file (named oc2arch-v1.0-csprd01.md):

pandoc -f gfm -t html oc2arch-v1.0-csprd01.md -c styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css --toc --toc-depth=5 -s -o oc2arch-v1.0-csprd01.html --metadata title="Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Architecture Specification Version 1.0"

We are currently using pandoc 2.6 from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.6.

This also requires the presence of a .css file containing the HTML styles (like styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css).
